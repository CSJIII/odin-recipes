       These potato skins are packed with creamy mashed sweet potatoes, black beans, diced tomatoes, and jalapeños.</p>

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>

       <ul>
         <li>5 small sweet potatoes, scrubbed and dried</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon olive oil, divided</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>1/3 cup vegan sour cream</li>
         <li>1/2 cup black beans</li>
         <li>1 small or 1/2 large tomato, diced (about 1/2 cup)</li>
         <li>1 jalapeño pepper, minced (about 3 tablespoons)</li>
         <li>Optional: 1/2 cup shredded vegan cheese</li>
         <li>For topping: extra vegan sour cream and sliced green onion</li>
       </ul>

       <h4>Steps</h4>

       <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Line baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake potatoes until fork tender, abut 40-45 minutes. Let cool until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise. Scoop out the inside of the potatoes, leaving about 1/4-inch of potato as the shell, and transfer the scooped out flesh to a medium mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Brush the inside and outside of the skins with remaining olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake skins for another 10 minutes or until start to get crispy.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, mash the sweet potato flesh in the mixing bowl using a fork or potato masher until smooth and creamy. Add sour cream, beans, tomatoes, jalapeño, and remaining salt to the mixing bowl and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Fill the insides of skins with sweet potato and bean mixture. Top with shredded vegan cheese if using.</li>
        <li>Bake until skins are crispy, filling is warm and cheese is melted, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional sour cream and green onion, as desired. Serve immediately.</li>
       </ol>
