       <h3>Ingredients</h3>

       <ul>
         <li>5 small to medium russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
         <li>Salt</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
         <li>1 leek, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
         <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
         <li>3 lightly packed cups kale, finely chopped</li>
         <li>1/4 cup water</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
         <li>1/4 cup vegan buttery spread, divided</li>
         <li>1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
       </ul>

       <h4>Steps</h4>

       <ol>
         <li>Add potatoes to a medium pot. Cover with cold water so potatoes are covered by an inch of water. Salt the water (about 1 tablespoon).</li>
         <li>Bring potatoes to a boil and boil until fork tender, about 15 minutes. Drain in colander.</li>
         <li>In the same pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add leeks and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
         <li>Add kale and toss to coat. Add water, cover and cook for 3-5 minutes. Remove cover and reduce heat to low, stirring occasionally. Cook until kale is tender, about 5 minutes. Season with nutmeg, salt and pepper.</li>
         <li>Add potatoes back to pot along with vegan buttery spread and almond milk and mash until creamy and combined with kale mixture. Season with more salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
         <li>Transfer to a serving dish and create a well in the middle of the potatoes to add remaining 2 tablespoons buttery spread to.</li>
         <li>Serve immediately.</li>
       </ol>
